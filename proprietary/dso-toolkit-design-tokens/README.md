# NL Design System design tokens for DSO Toolkit

**Applying design elements from this project is strictly prohibited without express permission from the DSO-Tookit project.**

These tokens have been obtained by analysing the [website of DSO Toolkit](https://www.dso-toolkit.nl). This is **NOT an official DSO-Toolkit project**. The official project can be found [on GitHub at dso-toolkit/dso-toolkit](https://github.com/dso-toolkit/dso-toolkit).

This project is part of a community iniative to discover how [NL Design System](https://designsystem.gebruikercentraal.nl) can be used to collaborate on web components across the boundaries of organisations by separating the design decisions from the component library.
